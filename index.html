    <h1 style="text-align:center;">The Strange Quantum World</h1>
       <div id="main">
              Quantum mechanics deals with very small scales and very high energies. It is governed by the famous Schrödinger Equation

              <p>
              \({\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}|\psi (t)\rangle ={\hat {H}}|\psi (t)\rangle }\)
              </p>
              The theory describes the behaviour of fundamental particles with high amount of precision. However, particles have also a strange wave-like property.
              Electrons "orbiting" an atom do not really orbit its center. For example, the hydrogen atom in its ground state, is given by its core surrounded by a spherical standing wave. 
              <p>
              Particles have also a discrete set of possible energies, from which is also seen by time independent Schrödinger equation in its eigenvalue form
              <p>
              \({\displaystyle {\hat {H}}|\psi \rangle = E  |\psi \rangle}\)
              </p>
              A solution for the time dependent equation, for time independent Hamiltonian is given as
              <p>
              \({\displaystyle \psi(x,t) = \psi(x) e^{-i E t / \hbar}}\)
              </p>
              which for many energy levels generalizes to the summation
              <p>
              \({\displaystyle \psi(x,t) = \sum_j \psi_j(x) e^{-i E_j t / \hbar}}\)
              </p>
              </p>
